## Key Initiatives

### 1. Software Reliability and Maintainability Upgrades

Last season's focus on migrating software towards newer versions with less security vunerabilities continues, as we seek to make APDA's software as durable, and readily maintainable as possible. Our targets for this season are as follows:
- Refactor to remove or update any dependencies that will not still be in long term service by 2028
- Create robust deployment pipelines for all essential software to prevent downtime from new changes
- Move all data storage onto dedicated enterprise database services
- Migrate services to containerized, scalable, stateless instances to lower costs
- Better data anayltics to catch bugs and downtime before they cause damage
- Performance optimization on all services

### 2. New Features

As our softare becomes more agile, so does out ability to push out new and exciting features to make our software better at what it does. Here are some of the big targets on our list:

- Connect Mit-Tab and standings with APIs to minimize manual data entry by admins and schools
- More ways to tell Mit-Tab what you want pairings to look like, such as setting up accessabile rooms to be automatically paired correctly
- More options to collect and aggregate speaks data

### 3. Infrastructure Improvements

Behind the scenes, we're working on:

- Modern style refreshes of all services
- Improve data communication on Mit-Tab with more options to make results visible, and display brackets in an outround format
