# Welcome to the APDA Tech Committee Blog

Welcome to the official blog of the American Parliamentary Debate Association's Tech Committee! This platform serves as a central hub for information, updates, and resources related to APDA's technology ecosystem. We've created this space to improve communication between the Tech Committee and the wider APDA community.

1. Increasing awareness of available tech resources
2. Gathering feedback from the community on new features
3. Documenting decisions and development processes
4. Providing a historical record of APDA's technical evolution
5. Recruiting technical contributors to our open-source projects
