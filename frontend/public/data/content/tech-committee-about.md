### MIT-Tab

Our flagship project is MIT-Tab, a tabulation software designed specifically for parliamentary debate tournaments. MIT-Tab handles pairings, judge assignments, room allocations, and results tabulation. We continually update and improve this software to meet the evolving needs of the debate community.

### APDA Website

We maintain the official APDA website, which serves as the central hub for association information, tournament announcements, and resources for the debate community.

### APDA Standings

We develop and manage the standings system that tracks team and speaker points throughout the competitive season, ensuring accurate and transparent rankings.

### Tech Committee Blog

This blog serves as our platform for sharing updates on our projects, announcing new features, documenting our processes, and engaging with the wider APDA community about technical matters.

### NU-Tab Deployer

We've created a deployment tool that simplifies the process of setting up tabulation software for tournaments, reducing technical barriers for tournament directors.
