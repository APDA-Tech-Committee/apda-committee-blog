# APDA Website

The APDA website, is the central hub for information about the American Parliamentary Debate Association. It contains elements like blog posts, the bylaws, and the forum. Below is an outline of what the website does, how it works, and what the future looks like:

## Features

- Tournament calender and information
- Resources for debaters and teams
- Member school directory
- News and announcements

## Technology Stack

- CMS: Wordpress
- Plugins: Asgaros Forum, Post SMTP, CAPTCHA 4WP, etc.
- Hosting: Linonde on an Ubuntu 20 box

## Current Development

- The wordpress site themeing can be rigid, and not as modern as other platforms. We're working to re-tool to improve the visual layout of the site.
- Wordpress is a ready to ship product, so most improvements are about stability, security and durability. We're working on reducing spam emails, and moving to more durable approaches for database backups to prevent data loss.

## Get Involved

If you're interested in contributing to the APDA website, please reach out to the Tech Committee. We're always looking for volunteers with web development experience.
